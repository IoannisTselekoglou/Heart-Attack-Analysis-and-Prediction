#input 10000 28x28 pixel image

#28x28=784 input layer
#increase bias
#get better understanding: 
# each neuron is connected to layer before that, with certain weights attachted to it and also a Bias number indicating activation
#cost function takes output of NN and compares it to be a 1 or 0 therfore its just outputvalue - possiblevalue
#  lower cost function means good values how good the NN acutally good , output 1 number 
# imagin this as a function and try to find minimum from f(x)

#using tangente helps decide in wich direction u should move your current possition to get the lowest value, --> aproches lokal minimum but how to find global minimumA

#3d with 2 inputs --> find downhil diretion 

#--> to find this minimum in 3d u can use the Gradient to find the direction of steepest increase
# --> step into negative direction :Task find this vector 
# Backpropagation
#
# Gradient descent 

#Take the input vector 12h12h
